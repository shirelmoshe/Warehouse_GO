# Supermarket Inventory System - Backend README

Welcome to the Supermarket Inventory System project's backend development. This document will guide you through the project setup, features, and development phases. Please make sure to reach out for any clarifications and always strive to be creative in your implementation.

## Project Overview
The Supermarket Inventory System is an inventory management software that aids supermarket management in tracking, managing, and organizing its inventory items. The system aims to optimize inventory levels, reduce costs, enhance customer service, and provide robust reporting and analytics.

## Tech Stack
To prepare you for real-world development, we'll use the following tech stack:

- **Frontend:**
  - React.JS with Ant.Design components, written in TypeScript.
  - Administrator and User dashboards for system management.
  
- **Backend:**
  - Node.JS using TypeScript (can be run using TS-Node).
  - Choose between MySQL or MongoDB for the database (more on that later).
  
- **Testing:**
  - Implement end-to-end testing using Playwright for both server and client.
  
- **Version Control:**
  - Use GitHub for source control to track your progress and collaborate with others.

## Study Materials
Here are some resources to help you get started with the technologies used in this project:

- TypeScript: Check out the TypeScript playlist and handbook documentation for in-depth learning.
- React.JS, Ant.Design, and Node.JS: Utilize official documentation and explore online courses on platforms like YouTube and Udemy to master these technologies.
- Playwright: Learn Playwright for end-to-end testing. Refer to Playwright's official documentation for guidance.

## Features
The Supermarket Inventory System is packed with features to streamline supermarket inventory management. Below are the key features:

1. **Product (Items) Management:**
   - Manage products with details like name, description, barcode, category, price, quantity, expiration date, supplier, and more.
   - Track product sales and handle damaged products.

2. **Categorize Products:**
   - Tag products to categorize them (e.g., Food, Kitchen Tools) for future analytics.

3. **Multi-location Inventory Management:**
   - Manage inventory across multiple stores, warehouses, or locations.
   - Track quantity, value, and movement of inventory items at each location.
   - Set up rules and permissions for each location.

4. **Warehouse and Fulfillment Management:**
   - Optimize warehouse operations, handle inbound and outbound shipments.
   - Manage order fulfillment, pick and pack orders, and track delivery status.

5. **Stock and Inventory:**
   - Maintain optimal inventory levels with reorder points and low stock alerts.
   - Automate reordering when stock falls below the threshold.
   - Analyze sales history and seasonality.

6. **User Management:**
   - Register store workers and online customers.
   - Implement user login and registration.
   - Track user operations, including cashier activities.

7. **Role Management (Optional):**
   - Define roles for different operations.
   - Limit user actions based on their roles.

8. **Dashboard and Data Visualization:**
   - Create a user dashboard with graphs and data visualization.
   - Display data on specific products, user sales, and more.

9. **Orders:**
   - Enable online product sales.
   - Implement cashier sales.
   - Manage the checkout process.
   - Handle payment methods (credit card and cash).

10. **Multiple Languages (Optional Advanced Feature):**
    - Support multiple languages and layout directions.
    - Manage text for different languages (i18n) in the project.

11. **Products Reviews (Optional):**
    - Allow users to review products.
    - Implement a system for reviewing products.

## Development Phases
We will build this project in a structured manner to ensure steady progress. The project will be divided into phases, each with its features. In addition to the features mentioned above, we will also work on the following phases:

1. **Build Basic UI:**
   - Create the project's user interface.
   - Design the structure, menus, login/logout, and different layouts.
   - Explore the possibility of making it a Single Page App (SPA) or Progressive Web App (PWA).

2. **Users and Login:**
   - Implement a user login system.
   - Differentiate between buyer and employee users.
   - Handle user registration and authentication.

3. **Products Management:**
   - Implement product management, including adding, removing, and updating products.
   - Manage product inventory and details.

4. **Orders:**
   - Create and manage orders for users.
   - Handle products in the shopping cart.
   - Manage order details, products, and order status.

5. **Dashboards and Data Visualization:**
   - Implement data visualization tools and dashboards.
   - Provide insights into the system's state and user-specific data.

6. **Extra Tasks (Bonuses):**
   - Implement additional features, such as multiple stores/branches, multiple languages, and product reviews.

Remember that you are encouraged to think creatively and suggest solutions for features that may lack detailed specifications. Also, consider the code architecture that best suits the project, and be prepared to learn new methods and technologies along the way.

## Set Up
Before diving into coding, you need to set up your development environment:

1. Create a new Git repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install React, TypeScript, Ant.Design components, Node.js, Express.js (or another server library), and any required packages.
3. Ensure your client runs on localhost and displays basic content.
4. Set up your Node.js server using Express.js or your chosen server library. Create a test route.
5. Choose between MySQL or MongoDB as your database, install the required packages, and establish a connection to the database.
6. Install Playwright for end-to-end testing.

For advanced developers, consider exploring WebSocket for real-time communication between the client and server.

## Contribution
This project is designed to assist you in gaining practical experience. Strive to find answers independently before seeking help. Use tools like ChatGPT/Bing Chat to enhance your understanding but do not overly rely on them.
